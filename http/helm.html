										<h1>Helm</h1>

									<p>
										When you accept microservices using containers you probably accept some form of duplication.  
										Docker aliviates this a great deal by using a layer hashing mechanishms to share layers between containers.  
										However, when building the containers they might have a great deal in common with one another.  
										They may share the same linux distribution, each may install the same packages for example <b>ca-certificates</b>, and some of the same files may be added to each one for example your companies tls certificates.
										This duplication is necessary because of dockers purpose, which is to include everything necessary to perform its function inside of the container.
									</p>

									<p>
										Similarly helm is designed in the same way.  A helm chart should deploy a single set of resources for a containerized service.  Lets use this site for example.  This site deployment has to have the following things: 
										<ul>
											<li>Some service to service html files (python/nginx)</li>
											<li>A service resource to resolve the html hosting service internally</li>
											<li>An ingress resource to define rules to route traffic through the cluster boundary</li>
											<li>Any RBAC/network policy resources for security definitions</li>
										</ul>

										A helm chart will deploy these things, and likely only these things because these things are what encapsulates the service running in Kubernetes.  
										What it shouldn't have to do is make any assumptions about something else being deployed.   
										As containers completely manage themselves, so should helm charts.
									</p>

									<h2>Distiction</h2>
									<p>
										Where this becomes an issue is for complex deployments.  
										Complex deployments should be encapsulated in umbrella's and each umbrella only deploy related objects.  
										For example we might have an umbrella chart, <b>Chart A</b>, which schedules jobs in the Kubernetes control plane, those jobs run to completion interacting with a database.
										We also want another service, <b>Chart B</b>, which deploys a logging stack containing elasticsearch, fluentd, and grafana.
										It would deploy these things as they are related.  Fluentd and grafana must know about elasticsearch.  
										Note that no service from <b>Chart A</b> need know about any service from <b>Chart B</b> and vice versa as fluentd picks up logs from the node filesystem.
										This angostic barrier should be encapsulated in umbrella charts.
									</p>

									<h2>Template sharing</h2>
									<p>
										The sharing of templates is a violation of the distinction that a helm chart is supposed to provide.  Lets consider again the docker example of layer sharing.  A hashed layer means something.  If I have a layer which looks like the following:
										<br />
										<pre>
<code>FROM alpine
ENV NAME Derek
RUN echo Hello $NAME</code>
										</pre>
										It will build and create the following layers:
										<pre>
<code>4407218c8304
6dafa5ced674
da94f8675cac</code>
										</pre>

										Now I will build another docker container, changing only the <b>FROM</b> layer, on the same system that looks like this:
										<pre>
<code>FROM ubuntu
ENV NAME Derek
RUN echo Hello $NAME</code>
										</pre>

										And I get the following layer hashes from the build:
										<pre>
<code>1b648fb900a0
5d56e245e97f
ae3976b92f6a</code>
										</pre>

										My 2nd and 3rd layers have changed they do the same thing!  
										While Layer 2 and Layer 3 perform the same thing in both containers context has changed.  
										There is no telling what setting environment variables or the echo command does in one from layer as you cant make any assumptions about what the binaries from the <b>FROM</b> layer actually do.
									</p>
									<p>
										This same distiction should apply to helm.  
										For example many charts use the pattern <code>RBAC: true</code>.  
										RBAC is a yaml key, which means nothing.  
										Setting this only means anything if the chart consuming it does something with it.
										Because of this you should not merge child elements into multiple charts even if it works, because it is an anti-pattern.
										Doing so violates the distinction of a helm chart.
